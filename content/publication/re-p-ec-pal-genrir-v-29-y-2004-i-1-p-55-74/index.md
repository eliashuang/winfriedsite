abstract: Microeconomic theory shows that only under certain conditions higher background
  risk increases the propensity to insure against independent marketable risks. We
  provide empirical evidence for the case of labor income risk and car insurance in
  the UK. The main result is that households with higher labor income risk spend more
  on insurance. This finding is consistent with microeconomic theory if the utility
  function is of the HARA type. Moreover, we find that households spend more on insurance
  if they participate in the stock market. The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance
  Theory (2004) 29, 55â€“74. doi:10.1023/B:GEPA.0000032566.45964.21
