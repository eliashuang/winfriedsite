abstract: " type=&quot;main&quot;> We analyze the general equilibrium of an economy\
  \ in which a competitive industry produces nonexclusive insurance services. The\
  \ equilibrium is inefficient because insurance contracts cannot control moral hazard,\
  \ and welfare can be improved by policies that reduce insurance by increasing its\
  \ price above marginal cost. We discuss how insurance production costs that exceed\
  \ expected claim payments interact with moral hazard in determining the equilibrium's\
  \ inefficiency, and show that these costs can make insurance premia so actuarially\
  \ unfair as to validate the standard first-order conditions we exploit in our analysis."
