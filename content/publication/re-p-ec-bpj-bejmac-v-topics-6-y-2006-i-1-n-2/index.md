abstract: In the recent macro literature the effect of competition has been analyzed
  by comparing economies with the same market structure but different degrees of substitutability.
  In this note, we argue that this approach may mingle the price effect of competition
  with a pure allocation effect. To illustrate the limitations of using the elasticity
  of substitution as a measure of competition, we present an example in which changes
  in the elasticity alter equilibrium allocations, but changes in the degree of market
  power do not. We use a simple static general equilibrium model in which sectors
  have different productivity. Then, higher substitutability always shifts resources
  towards the more productive sectors. Instead, changes in the market structure (monopolistic
  competition versus Bertrand duopoly) do not affect the relative price of consumption
  goods if the markups are symmetric, implying that the induced changes in competition
  do not have any price effect on equilibrium allocations.
