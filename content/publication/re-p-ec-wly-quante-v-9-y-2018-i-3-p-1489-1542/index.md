abstract: This paper develops a notion of consumer confidence within a dynamic competitive
  equilibrium framework. In any situation where multiple equilibrium prices on next‐period
  spot markets are equally supported by the state of the economy, confidence is encoded
  in the subjective probabilities consumers attach to these multiple future outcomes.
  Our approach characterizes the set of all equilibrium‐consistent subjective probabilities,
  and thereby endogenizes the extent of uncertainty faced by consumers. We use the
  structure of an economy with collateralized household debt and housing markets to
  develop and illustrate this concept. Our approach determines the specific range
  of debt levels at which this economy is vulnerable to crises of confidence, as well
  as the debt‐level‐specific extent of confidence‐driven house price fluctuations.
