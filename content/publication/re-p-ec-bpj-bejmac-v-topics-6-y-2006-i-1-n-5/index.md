abstract: Although a lot has been written on the link between debt maturity and financial
  crises, it remains puzzling why the private sector in emerging market economies
  holds such a large share of short-term debt in the presence of substantial macroeconomic
  risk. To understand this phenomenon, we propose a simple model in which debt maturity
  depends on economic uncertainty about investment returns. We show in particular
  that if lenders are risk averse, higher uncertainty can (i) lower the total debt
  level a country is able to borrow and (ii) tilt the debt profile towards short-term
  debt. We take these model implications to the data using a panel of 28 emerging
  market economies and various indicators for macroeconomic uncertainty. We find substantial
  empirical support for the model's predictions.
