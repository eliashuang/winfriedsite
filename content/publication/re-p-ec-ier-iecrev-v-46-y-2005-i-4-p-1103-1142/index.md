abstract: " Price discrimination incentives may induce dealers to bear the financial\
  \ cost of their customers' credit purchases. We focus on how financial market imperfections\
  \ make it possible to segment the customer population. When borrowing and lending\
  \ rates differ from each other and from the rate of interest on a durable good purchase,\
  \ the structure of those rates influences customers' choices to purchase on credit\
  \ or cash terms, and the scope for dealers' price discrimination. Empirical analysis\
  \ of a set of installment-credit, personal-loan, and regional interest rate data\
  \ offers considerable support to the assumptions and implications of our theoretical\
  \ framework. Copyright 2005 by the Economics Department Of The University Of Pennsylvania\
  \ And Osaka University Institute Of Social And Economic Research Association."
