abstract: 'We characterize optimal redistribution in a dynastic economy with observable
  human capital and hidden ability. We show that the wedge between human capital investment
  in the laissez faire and the social optimum differs from the wedge for bequests
  because (i) returns to human capital are risky, and (ii) human capital may change
  informational rents. We compute the optimal allocation when ability is persistent
  across generations, as calibrated for the U.S. We show how the allocation can be
  implemented with student loans featuring contingent repayments. The quantitative
  results reveal that human capital investment should (i) increase in parental income
  because of ability transmission across generations, but (ii) decrease in inherited
  assets because of the negative effect of wealth on labor supply. (Copyright: Elsevier)'
