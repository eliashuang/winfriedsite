abstract: ' Employment protection legislation (EPL) is an important labour market
  policy whose strictness differs greatly across OECD countries. The collection of
  articles in this Feature provides new theoretical and empirical results which highlight
  the impact of EPL on productivity, job and firm turnover, (un)employment and the
  incidence of temporary contracts. Importantly, the effect of EPL is shown to differ
  across types of workers and firms. This yields new insights on the incentives for
  labour market reform. Copyright 2007 The Author(s). Journal compilation Royal Economic
  Society 2007.'
