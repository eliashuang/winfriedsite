abstract: 'Durables like cars or houses are a substantial component in the balance
  sheets of households. These durables are exposed to risk and can be insured in the
  market. We build a dynamic model in which agents have three possibilities to cope
  with the risk exposure of the durable stock: (i) purchase of market insurance, (ii)
  buffer-stock saving of the riskless asset or (iii) adjustment of the durable stock.
  We calibrate our model to the US economy and find a small role for market insurance.
