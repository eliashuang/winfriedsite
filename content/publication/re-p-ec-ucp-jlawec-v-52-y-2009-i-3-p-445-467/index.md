abstract: ' Personal bankruptcy regulation and redistributive taxes and transfers
  vary considerably across U.S. states and over time. Our hypothesis is that both
  policies are imperfect substitutes in insuring consumption of risk-averse agents
  in incomplete markets. Exploiting data variation over time for 18 U.S. states for
  the period 1980-2003, we find considerable support for this hypothesis: redistributive
  taxation and bankruptcy exemptions are negatively correlated, and both policies
  are associated with more equal consumption growth. (c) 2009 by The University of
