abstract: We show theoretically that income redistribution benefits borrowing-constrained
  individuals more than is implied by standard relative-income and uninsurable-risk
  considerations. Empirically, we find in international opinion-survey data that younger
  and lower-income individuals express stronger support for government redistribution
  in countries where consumer credit is less easily available. This evidence supports
  our theoretical perspective if such individuals are more strongly affected by tighter
  credit supply, in that expectations of higher incomes in the future increase their
  propensity to borrow.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version
  of this item.)</small>
