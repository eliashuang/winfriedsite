abstract: We exploit information on the joint dynamics of household labor income,
  consumption, and wealth in the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth to
  structurally estimate a buffer‐stock saving model. We compare the degree of consumption
  smoothing implied by the model to the corresponding empirical estimates based on
  the same data set. We estimate that Italian households smooth 12% of permanent income
  shocks in the data that is comparable to the model counterpart of 11% . This result
  contrasts with existing evidence, and our own findings in this article, of substantially
  more consumption smoothing in U.S. data.
