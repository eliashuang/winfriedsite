 abstract = {We exploit information on the joint dynamics of household labor income, consumption, and wealth in the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth to structurally estimate a buffer‐stock saving model. We compare the degree of consumption smoothing implied by the model to the corresponding empirical estimates based on the same data set. We estimate that Italian households smooth 12% of permanent income shocks in the data that is comparable to the model counterpart of 11% . This result contrasts with existing evidence, and our own findings in this article, of substantially more consumption smoothing in U.S. data.},
