abstract: 'We use all available waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances to document
  the evolution of the wealth distribution in the US since the 1980s. Relying on the
  shape of this distribution we then estimate a life-cycle incomplete markets model.
  We find that considering a wide range of net worth percentiles for prime-age consumers
  between ages 26 and 55 delivers very precise estimates of the structural parameters,
  impatience and risk aversion. The estimated model captures how average net worth
  increases with age while the dispersion of net worth falls with age. The model also
  predicts some of the evolution of the net worth distribution since the 1980s. Feeding
  the observed higher labor income risk into the model increases precautionary savings
  while the higher experience premium of labor earnings reduces wealth accumulation.
  Quantitatively, these two forces imply that the model reproduces the stable average
  net worth for young consumers since the 1980s and the increasing dispersion of net
  worth for all prime-age consumers, while the model does not predict the observed
  increase of average net worth for older consumers between ages 46 and 55. (Copyright:
