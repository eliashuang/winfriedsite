abstract: ' Why are firm and job turnover rates so similar across OECD countries?
  We argue that this may be due to the joint regulation of product and labour markets.
  For our analysis, we build a stochastic equilibrium model with search frictions
  and heterogeneous multiple-worker firms. This allows us to distinguish firm entry
  and exit from hiring and firing in a model with equilibrium unemployment. We show
  that firing costs, sunk entry costs and bureaucratic flow costs have countervailing
  effects on firm and job turnover as different types of firms select to operate in
  the market. Copyright 2007 The Author(s). Journal compilation Royal Economic Society
