abstract: This paper investigates the economic relevance of the large differences
  in homestead exemptions across US states. We build a structural model for an equilibrium
  analysis of debt-portfolio choices over the life cycle. Our analysis captures key
  patterns from the observed cross-sectional distributions of secured debt, unsecured
  debt, and of home equity. The model predicts that harmonizing the amount of home
  equity exempt in bankruptcy procedures has quantitatively negligible effects on
  the interest rate of unsecured debt and on welfare, unless the exemption is eliminated.
  The small welfare effect may rationalize why the differences in homestead exemptions
  are so persistent.
